# 🤖 Basic Jarvis – Beginner Voice Assistant in Python

A very basic voice assistant I built as part of my Python learning journey.  
Jarvis can currently open websites and play music based on voice commands.

## 🔍 What It Can Do:
- Take voice input using `speech_recognition`
- Use `pyttsx3` for voice replies
- Open websites with `webbrowser`
- Play music from your local directory

## 🧠 Tech Stack:
- `speech_recognition`
- `pyttsx3`
- `webbrowser`
- `os`

## ⚠️ Known Issues:
- Sometimes misinterprets commands due to mic/noise issues
- Still learning how to make it more responsive and flexible!

## 📝 Note:
This was made while watching a tutorial and experimenting with voice-based automation.  
It’s buggy—but I’m working on making it better!

## 🌱 Next Goals:
- Add more commands
- Handle errors better
- Maybe add a GUI or chatbot interface
